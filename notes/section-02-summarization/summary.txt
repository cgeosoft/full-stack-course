Boeing CEO, Dave Calhoun, addressed workers at subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems following the blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. Calhoun stated that both Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems will work together to ensure that engineers, mechanics, and inspectors are aligned in their efforts to improve. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) named Spirit AeroSystems for the first time in its investigation into Boeing's quality control. The investigation seeks to determine why a door plug blew off the plane, causing a hole in the side. The Boeing 737 Max 9 remains grounded in the US until the FAA releases a final directive on inspections. This is not the first time that Spirit AeroSystems' work has caused issues for Boeing, with a previous incident in April delaying deliveries and production. Spirit AeroSystems is a major Boeing contractor, accounting for 62% of its revenue.
