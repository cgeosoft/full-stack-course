Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, addressed workers at Spirit AeroSystems, its subcontractor responsible for building the 737 Max 9 fuselage, and stated that they will learn from the recent incident on an Alaska Airlines flight. The incident, where a door plug blew off, causing a hole in the plane, prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to investigate Boeing's quality control practices and specifically name Spirit AeroSystems in the investigation. The FAA is currently conducting inspections on 40 out of 171 grounded 737 Max planes, and once approved, all airlines with 737 Max planes will need to complete the inspection before their planes can fly again. This is not the first time Spirit AeroSystems has caused problems for Boeing, as a previous incident involving a non-standard manufacturing process in the rear fuselage fittings for the 737 Max caused delays and additional inspections. Spirit AeroSystems is a major Boeing contractor, accounting for 62% of its revenue.
