The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Twitter account was hacked, leading to a false announcement that the regulator had approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). SEC Chair Gary Gensler confirmed the hack, stating that the agency has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETFs. The SEC is working with law enforcement to investigate the unauthorized access and any related misconduct. The incident sparked humor among some, but the price of bitcoin did not experience significant volatility in response. Numerous investment firms have applied to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, which would make bitcoin investing more accessible to retail investors.
